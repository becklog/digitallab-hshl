### A Note on Adding Images

![logo](logo.png "Designed with Illustrator")

To add an image to your site with markdown, you have two options. You can use an image you upload into your repository or provide a link to an image hosted elsewhere. There is already a fantastic guide [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#images-1) if you want more details.

To add an image from your repository, you need to first upload the image to your site's GitHub repository. Then you put the full name of the file as the "src" in the image syntax.

You can also put a link to an image already hosted elsewhere (typically found by right clicking and selecting "copy image address") into the "src" to get it to load that way.
